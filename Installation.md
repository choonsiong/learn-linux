# Installation

- *BIOS* is responsible for detecting the hardware components, configuring the hardware, and starting the operating system.
- Intel developed the *EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface)* successor to BIOS in 1998.
    - Renamed to *UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)* after the participation of AMD, Apple, Microsoft, and others.
    - The biggest advantages compared to BIOS is EFI allows you to choose which of several installed operating systems you want to start when you boot the computer.
        - In the BIOS past, the *GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)* program is used
    - EFI requires a special partition called the *EFI System Partition (ESP)*
        - The ESP must contain a VFAT file system, which is a Windows 95 compatible file system
            - The partition must be specially marked
            - `/boot/efi`
            - ESP size at least 512 MiB, it is almost impossible to increase the size at a later date

- Download ISO images
    - Burn to a DVD (or a USB flash drive) and boot the computer with it
        - to write ISO image to drive use program like [etcher](https://etcher.balena.io) or `dd` command on Linux
    - On a virtual machine, use the ISO image as a virtual DVD drive
- Network installation - the installation files are read from the network
    - Option 1, the installation is started from a USB flash drive, then the installer helps to establish the network connection and then loads all other data from the internet or from the local network
    - Option 2, requires that your computer can load the boot data from the local network, there must be a server on the local network that offers the Linux installer in the form of boot data

- Cloud installation - the hosting or cloud company will take care the installation, you just select the desired distribution with your configuration (e.g. RAM size, CPU, etc) such as [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/?trk=361ccc4f-68c4-4038-bf6c-0586bee109dc&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwqv2_BhC0ARIsAFb5Ac9KNW2bFjrAe67u0VdYGop9Q6KG5b4R_cVLdpLf384wPk-mMRWk7B0aAm9xEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!476956795566!e!!g!!aws%20ec2!11543056243!112002963829&gbraid=0AAAAADjHtp90lMj5bEGNJRBabJ-1LbCMw&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqv2_BhC0ARIsAFb5Ac9KNW2bFjrAe67u0VdYGop9Q6KG5b4R_cVLdpLf384wPk-mMRWk7B0aAm9xEALw_wcB)

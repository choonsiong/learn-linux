# Installation

- *BIOS* is responsible for detecting the hardware components, configuring the hardware, and starting the operating system.
- Intel developed the *EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface)* successor to BIOS in 1998.
    - Renamed to *UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)* after the participation of AMD, Apple, Microsoft, and others.
    - The biggest advantages compared to BIOS is EFI allows you to choose which of several installed operating systems you want to start when you boot the computer.
        - In the BIOS past, the *GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)* program is used
    - EFI requires a special partition called the *EFI System Partition (ESP)*
        - The ESP must contain a VFAT file system, which is a Windows 95 compatible file system
            - The partition must be specially marked
            - `/boot/efi`
            - ESP size at least 512 MiB, it is almost impossible to increase the size at a later date

- Download ISO images
    - Burn to a DVD (or a USB flash drive) and boot the computer with it
        - to write ISO image to drive use program like [etcher](https://etcher.balena.io) or `dd` command on Linux
    - On a virtual machine, use the ISO image as a virtual DVD drive
- Network installation - the installation files are read from the network
    - Option 1, the installation is started from a USB flash drive, then the installer helps to establish the network connection and then loads all other data from the internet or from the local network
    - Option 2, requires that your computer can load the boot data from the local network, there must be a server on the local network that offers the Linux installer in the form of boot data

- Cloud installation - the hosting or cloud company will take care the installation, you just select the desired distribution with your configuration (e.g. RAM size, CPU, etc) such as [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/), then log in via SSH either using the cloud console or Linux terminal.

    - Text mode installation
    - Graphics mode installation

    - Linux alone or in parallel with Windows
    - Multiple distributions on one computer?
- Overview of the installation process (with Microsoft Windows already installed)
    - Downsize Windows partition (do it on Windows)
        - Partitions are sections on the SSD or hard disk
        - Different operating systems often use different file systems - that is, different methods of storing files within the partition
        - Methods for managing partitioning information on an SSD or hard disk
            - **GPT (GUID partition tables)** - used in internal SSDs and hard disks since 2012            
                - with [GPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table), each partition is identified by a *GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)*
                - all partitions are equal, there is no distinction between primary, extended, and logical partitions
                - each partition can be up to 8 zettabytes (ZiB) in size (about a billion TiB)
                - the partition numbers do not have to match the actual order of the partitions
            - **MBR (Master Boot Record)** - is outdated but still used today, mainly in virtual machines with disks smaller than 2TiB and with external disks
                - intended for disks up to a maximum of 2 TiB
                - three types of partitions
                    - primary
                    - extended
                    - logical
                - a maximum of four primary partitions can exist on the hard disk
                - it is also possible to define an extended partition instead of one of these four primary partitions
                    - inside the extended partition, we can create multiple logical partitions
                    - an extended partition serves only as a container for logical partitions
                        - only primary and logical partitions are suitable for the actual storage of data
            - Partition names
                - Windows - `A:`, `B:`, `C:`, etc
                - Linux - `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sda2`, `/dev/sdb1`, `/dev/nvme0n1p1`, etc
                    - Hard disks and SATA SSDs - `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`
                    - NVMe interface - `/dev/nvme`
                    - GPT
                        - All partitions are simply numbered in sequence
                    - MBR
                        - The numbers from 1 to 4 are reserved for primary and extended partitions
                            - Logical partitions always start with the number 5
    - Prepare USB flash drive (copy the ISO image)
    - Start Linux installation
    - Create Linux partitions
    - Select installation scope
    - Configuration
    - Setup boot loader (mostly GRUB) - responsible for starting Linux
        - For EFI machines, the boot loader is installed in a directory of the ESP

## Notes

- A hobby project of the Finnish programmer *Linus Torvalds*.
- Linux is a Unix-like operating system.
	- An operating system is a bundle of programs that realize the basic functions of a computer. This includes managing the keyboard, screen, and mouse as well as the system resources.
- Strictly speaking, the term *Linux* only refers to the *kernel*, the innermost part (i.e., the core) of an operating system with very basic functions, such as memory management, process management, and control of the hardware.
- A *Linux distribution* is the unit that consists of the actual operating system (kernel) and many additional programs. A distribution allows for a quick and convenient installation of Linux.

### Shells

- A *login shell* exists when you log in to a text console or when you work via SSH on an external computer. This means that the shell is started immediately after authentication and then (interactively) accepts and processes your commands.
- On the other hand, we speak of an *interactive shell* if the login has already happened earlier and the shell is started later - if required. This is always true if you first log into a desktop system and then open a terminal window. There again a shell is started, which waits for your commands.

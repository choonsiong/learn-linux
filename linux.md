## Notes

### Shells

- A *login shell* exists when you log in to a text console or when you work via SSH on an external computer. This means that the shell is started immediately after authentication and then (interactively) accepts and processes your commands.
- On the other hand, we speak of an *interactive shell* if the login has already happened earlier and the shell is started later - if required. This is always true if you first log into a desktop system and then open a terminal window. There again a shell is started, which waits for your commands.

## Notes

- Linux is a Unix-like operating system.
	- An operating system is a bundle of programs that realize the basic functions of a computer. This includes managing the keyboard, screen, and mouse as well as the system resources.
- Strictly speaking, the term *Linux* only refers to the *kernel*, the innermost part (i.e., the core) of an operating system with very basic functions, such as memory management, process management, and control of the hardware.

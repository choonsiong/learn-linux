## Notes

- A hobby project of the Finnish programmer *Linus Torvalds*.
- Linux is a Unix-like operating system.
	- An operating system is a bundle of programs that realize the basic functions of a computer. This includes managing the keyboard, screen, and mouse as well as the system resources.
	- Popular operating systems include Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS.
	- The [500 fastest computers](https://top500.org/statistics/list/) in the world today all run Linux.
- Strictly speaking, the term *Linux* only refers to the *kernel*, the innermost part (i.e., the core) of an operating system with very basic functions, such as memory management, process management, and control of the hardware.
- A *Linux distribution* is the unit that consists of the actual operating system (kernel) and many additional programs. A distribution allows for a quick and convenient installation of Linux.
	- Difference between distributions
		- Scope and up-to-dateness
		- Installation and configuration tools
		- Configuration of the desktop (KDE and GNOME)
		- Hardware support
		- Updates
		- Rolling release
		- Live system
		- Target platform (CPU architecture)
		- Support
		- License
	- Common Linux distributions
		- AlmaLinux - a RHEL clone
		- Android - developed by Google for mobile devices and tablets
		- Arch Linux - a rolling release distribution for technical users
		- CentOS - end in December 2020
		- CentOS Stream - unsuitable for long-term production use
		- Chrome OS - developed by Google, optimized for notebooks and requires an active internet connection
		- Debian - one of the oldest entirely free distribution, is intended for advanced Linux users
		- Fedora - the free development branch of Red Hat Linux, new Linux features are often found in Fedora first and only later in other distributions
		- Kali Linux - based on Debian, includes a huge collection of hacking and pen-testing tools
		- openSUSE - a free Linux distribution based on enterprise versions of SUSE, but specifically intended for home users and developers
		- Oracle Linux - a variant of RHEL from Oracle
		- Red Hat - acquired by IBM in 2018, is the best-known and most successful Linux company in the world
		- Ubuntu - the most popular distribution for home users by Canonical

### Shells

- A *login shell* exists when you log in to a text console or when you work via SSH on an external computer. This means that the shell is started immediately after authentication and then (interactively) accepts and processes your commands.
- On the other hand, we speak of an *interactive shell* if the login has already happened earlier and the shell is started later - if required. This is always true if you first log into a desktop system and then open a terminal window. There again a shell is started, which waits for your commands.

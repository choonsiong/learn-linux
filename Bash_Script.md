# `bash` Script

- Scripts are text files that contain Linux and `bash` commands.
- Scripts can contain branches, loops, and functions.
    - This means that `bash` is a simple programming language.
- The first line of the bash script is called *shebang* or *hashbang* and starts with the `#!` character combination. This is followed by the path to the interpreter that will execute the following code.
- Shell scripts can only be executed if the access bits for read access (r) and execution (x) are set `chmod +x myscript`.

# Networking

A *network* is simply a collection of computers or other hardware devices that are connected together, either physically or logically, using special hardware and software that allows the devices to exchange information and cooperate.

*Networking* is the term that describes the processes involved in designing, implementing, upgrading, managing, and otherwise working with networks and network technologies.

> A network is a set of hardware devices connected together, either physically or logically. This allows them to exchange information.

### Advantages of Networking:

- Connectivity and communication - Networks connect computers and the users of those computers.
- Data sharing - One of the most important uses of networking is to allow the sharing of data.
- Hardware sharing - Networks facilitate the sharing of hardware devices.
- Internet access - The Internet is itself an enormous network, so whenever you access the Internet, you are using a network.
- Internet access sharing - Small computer networks allow multiple users to share a single Internet connection.
- Data security and management - In a business environment, a network allows the administrators to manage the company's critical data better.
- Performance enhancement and balancing - You can use a network to enhance the overall performance of some applications by distributing the computation tasks to various computers on the network.
- Entertainment - Network facilitates many types of games and entertainment.

> At a higher level, networks are advantageous because they allow computers and people to be connected together so that they can share resources. Some of the specific benefits of networking include communication, data sharing, Internet access, data security and management, application performance enhancement, and entertainment.

### Disadvantages of Networking:

- Network hardware, software, and setup costs - Setting up a network requires an investment in hardware and software, as well as funds for planning, designing, and implementing the network.
- Hardware and software management and administration costs - In all but the smallest of implementations, ongoing maintenance and management of the network requires the care and attention of an IT professional.
- Undesirable sharing - Networking allows the easy sharing of useful information, it also allows the sharing of undesirable data.
- Illegal or undesirable behavior - Networking facilitates useful connectivity and communication, but also brings difficulties with it.
    - abuse of company resources
    - distraction that reduce productivity
    - downloading of illegal or illicit materials
    - software piracy
- Data security concerns - If a network is implemented properly, it is possible to greatly improve the security of important data. In contrast, a poorly secured network puts critical data at risk, exposing it to the potential problems associated with hackers, unauthorized access, and even sabotage.

> Networking has a few drawbacks that you can weigh against its many positive aspects. Setting up a network has costs in hardware, software, maintenance, and administration. It is also necessary to manage a network to keep it running smoothly and to address possible misuse or abuse issues. Data security also becomes a much bigger concern when computers are connected together.

## Networking Protocols

- Networking protocols define a language and a set of rules and procedures that enable devices and systems to communicate.
- Networking protocols concern themselves with ensuring that all the devices on a network or internetwork are in agreement about how various actions must be performed in the total communication process.
- A protocol is thus basically a way of ensuring that devices are able to talk to each other effectively.
- In most cases, an individual protocol describes how communication is accomplished between one particular software or hardware element in two or more devices.

> A networking protocol defines a set of rules, algorithms, messages, and other mechanisms that enables software and hardware in networked devices to communicate effectively. A protocol usually describes a means for communication between corresponding entities at the same OSI Reference Model layer in two or more devices.

## Circuit Switching & Packet Switching

Networks are devices that are connected together using special hardware and software that allows them to exchange information. There are many methods for exchanging information between networked devices. One fundamental way to differentiate between networking technologies is on the basis of the method used to determine the path between devices over which information will flow. A path can be set up between the devices in advance, or the data can be sent as individual data elements over a variable path.

### Circuit Switching

- In the *circuit-switching* networking method, a connection called a circuit, which is used for the whole communication, is set up between two devices.
- The circuit may be either a fixed one that is always present or one that is created on an as-needed basis.
    - even if many potential paths through intermediate devices may exist between the two devices that are communicating, only one will be used for any given dialogue 
- The classic example of a circuit-switched network is the telephone system.

> One way that networking technologies are categorized is based on the path used to carry data between devices. In circuit switching, a circuit is first established and then used to carry all data between devices. In packet switching, no fixed path is created between devices that communicate; it is broken into packets, each of which may take a separate path from sender to recipient.
